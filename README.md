# tap-a-lap-splash!

tap-a-lap-splash! is a rhythmic meditation for swimmers and the people who love them, made with A-Frame and Tone.js. You can check it out here: [**DEMO**](https://tapalapsplash.everyoneisugly.com/)



#### Background

While participating in School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe's [course on making personal games](http://schoolofma.org/getting-personal.html) in fall 2020, I began ideating on the concept of a rhythm game about swimming and finding your flow. As my final project for [Gray Area's 2020.2 Creative Code Immersive](https://grayarea.org/learn/immersive/) I decided to make this concept a reality in a web-based prototype. This version of the project was exhibited in the [Gray Area Artist Showcase Winter 2020](https://grayarea.org/event/gray-area-artist-winter-showcase-2020/). I'm very grateful to both organizations for providing structure and mentorship to make this prototype happen!



#### How it Works

This prototype relies on [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for the core mechanics. The player uses their keyboard to swim and breathe, and these actions in turn influence the musical loops of the environment. 

In addition to the core A-Frame library, I also made use of the [A-Frame Extras ocean component](https://github.com/n5ro/aframe-extras) and [AFrame GIF Shader](https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-gif-shader).
